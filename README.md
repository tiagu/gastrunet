# GastrUnet
Gastrunet is a pipeline for fast semantic segmentation of microscopy images of 3D cell cultures for the purpose of analysing their overall shape and growth. 


## Overview:
This repository provides an example of how a neural network can be trained with a small number of manually-segmented images as ground-truth. I also include a notebook with several analyses performed on notoroids (see Rito et al. 2023). The pipeline makes use of the fastai deep learning library as well as xxx and xxx.
